                <h1>What is the history of the croissant?</h1>
                <p>What comes to your mind when you think about a fresh flaky croissant with its scattering crumbs and satisfying crunch? 
                    Well, if you’ve been to Paris, then you’ll probably conjure up the image of the French capital on a lazy morning 
                    drinking a steamy cup of coffee with a croissant! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and enjoyable on all sides! 
                    The croissant is as connected to France as a baguette. But what’s the origin of this popular and beloved French pastry?

                    
                </p>
                <p>Most food historians trace the humble origins of the croissant to Austria, 
                    where a simple pastry was a staple food since at least the 13th century. 
                    Denser and sweeter than the modern croissant, it’s believed that this dough began to 
                    change in the 17th century and became known as kipferl (the German word for crescent). 
                    It would eventually morph into what is today known as the croissant.

                <p>
                    One of the main reasons why croissant is popular the world over is because of their versatility. 
                    You can either eat a croissant alone or stuff it with other accompaniments. 
                    I recommend that you try both versions but start with the croissant in its very traditional form before experimenting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the most savoury fillings include ham, cheese, bacon, raw ham, eggs, bechamel sauce, 
                    spinach, parmesan cheese, and many more. If you love sweet fillings, you can also try 
                    fillings such as caramel milk, jam, fruits, and chocolate. In essence, 
                    the croissant is so versatile that it can be used as sandwich bread.
